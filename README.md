# Automatic-Cotton-Crop-Harvesting-System

As part of KITE, the technology innovation platform of AMTDC-IIT Madras, I contributed to an interdisciplinary project focused on designing an automatic cotton crop harvesting system. My role involved automating the process of cotton identification using machine learning in Python, specifically employing the YOLO algorithm. I collected, cleansed, and analyzed the data before developing the model.

Technologies Used: Python, Machine Learning, YOLO Algorithm, Data Collection and Cleansing
